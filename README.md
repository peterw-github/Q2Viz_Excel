# A Power BI visualisation, of a mock companies, Q2 YoY Performance.

<br>
<br>

Hello!

The purpose of this project, was to demonstrate my experience with Excel (including the use of Vlookup, Xlookup, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, PivotTables, etc), and Power BI. 

In the project, I downloaded a small dataset (csv file), of a mock company, cleaned up the data, then did some variance analysis, in order to determine how the company performed, in Q2 2021, in terms of YoY Growth. (YoY growth was the primary focus, as I determined from the cleaned data, that the mock company has seasonality).

I found that Q2 YoY growth, was 2.7%, which is positive, but Q1 YoY was 4%, so the mock company did not maintain steady growth from Q1 YoY to Q2 YoY, there was a slowdown of 1.3%.

Upon investigating, I found 4 specific clients, that were the main contributors, to the company-wide slowdown.

I've also made a single page, summary report, in Excel, which can be previewed here: <br>
